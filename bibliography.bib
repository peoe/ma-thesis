The latter arise in semi-discretizations of fluid flow problems, such as Burgers’ equation or the Navier-Stokes equations. In the linear case, the Loewner framework is data-driven and constructs a ROM from measurements of the transfer function; it does not explicitly require access to the system matrices, which is attractive in many settings. Research on extending the Loewner framework to quadratic-bilinear systems is ongoing. This paper presents one extension and provides details of its implementation that allow application to large-scale problems. This extension is applied to Burgers’ equation. Numerical results show the potential of the Loewner framework, but also expose additional issues that need to be addressed to make it fully applicable. Possible approaches to deal with some of these issues are outlined.},

   abstract = {A continuous Galerkin finite element method that allows mixed boundary conditions without the need for Lagrange multipliers or user-defined parameters is developed. A mixed coupling of Lagrange and Raviart-Thomas basis functions are used. The method is proven to have a Hamiltonian-conserving spatial discretisation and a symplectic time discretisation. The energy residual is therefore guaranteed to be bounded for general problems and exactly conserved for linear problems. The linear 2D wave equation is discretised and modelled by making use of a port-Hamiltonian framework. This model is verified against an analytic solution and shown to have standard order of convergence for the temporal and spatial discretisation. The error growth over time is shown to grow linearly for this symplectic method, which agrees with theoretical results. A modal analysis is performed which verifies that the eigenvalues of the model accurately converge to the exact eigenvalues, as the mesh is refined. The port-Hamiltonian framework allows boundary coupling with bond-graph or, more generally, lumped parameter models, therefore unifying the two fields of lumped parameter modelling and continuum modelling of Hamiltonian systems. The wave domain discretisation is shown to be equivalent to a coupling of canonical port-Hamiltonian forms. This feature allows the model to have mixed boundary conditions as well as to have mixed causality interconnections with other port-Hamiltonian models. A model of the 2D wave equation is coupled, in a monolithic manner, with a lumped parameter model of an electromechanical linear actuator. The combined model is also verified to conserve energy exactly.},

   abstract = {For a projection-based reduced order model (ROM) of a fluid flow to be stable and accurate, the dynamics of the truncated subspace must be taken into account. This paper proposes an approach for stabilizing and enhancing projection-based fluid ROMs in which truncated modes are accounted for a priori via a minimal rotation of the projection subspace. Attention is focused on the full non-linear compressible Navier-Stokes equations in specific volume form as a step toward a more general formulation for problems with generic non-linearities. Unlike traditional approaches, no empirical turbulence modeling terms are required, and consistency between the ROM and the Navier-Stokes equation from which the ROM is derived is maintained. Mathematically, the approach is formulated as a trace minimization problem on the Stiefel manifold. The reproductive as well as predictive capabilities of the method are evaluated on several compressible flow problems, including a problem involving laminar flow over an airfoil with a high angle of attack, and a channel-driven cavity flow problem.},

   abstract = {A quadratic approximation manifold is presented for performing nonlinear, projection-based, model order reduction (PMOR). It constitutes a departure from the traditional affine subspace approximation that is aimed at mitigating the Kolmogorov barrier for nonlinear PMOR, particularly for convection-dominated transport problems. It builds on the data-driven approach underlying the traditional construction of projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs); is application-independent; is linearization-free; and therefore is robust for highly nonlinear problems. Most importantly, this approximation leads to quadratic PROMs that deliver the same accuracy as their traditional counterparts using however a much smaller dimension – typically, n2∼n1, where n2 and n1 denote the dimensions of the quadratic and traditional PROMs, respectively. The computational advantages of the proposed high-order approach to nonlinear PMOR over the traditional approach are highlighted for the detached-eddy simulation-based prediction of the Ahmed body turbulent wake flow, which is a popular CFD benchmark problem in the automotive industry. For a fixed accuracy level, these advantages include: a reduction of the total offline computational cost by a factor greater than five; a reduction of its online wall clock time by a factor greater than 32; and a reduction of the wall clock time of the underlying high-dimensional model by a factor greater than two orders of magnitude.},

In contrast to state-of-the-art model reduction methods that are intrusive and thus require full knowledge of the governing equations and the operators of a full model of the discretized dynamical system, the proposed approach requires only the non-polynomial terms in analytic form and learns the rest of the dynamics from snapshots computed with a potentially black-box full-model solver. The proposed method learns operators for the linear and polynomially nonlinear dynamics via a least-squares problem, where the given non-polynomial terms are incorporated on the right-hand side. The least-squares problem is linear and thus can be solved efficiently in practice. The proposed method is demonstrated on three problems governed by partial differential equations, namely the diffusion–reaction Chafee–Infante model, a tubular reactor model for reactive flows, and a batch-chromatography model that describes a chemical separation process. The numerical results provide evidence that the proposed approach learns reduced models that achieve comparable accuracy as models constructed with state-of-the-art intrusive model reduction methods that require full knowledge of the governing equations.},

   abstract = {The Koopman operator allows for handling nonlinear systems through a globally linear representation. In general, the operator is infinite-dimensional – necessitating finite approximations – for which there is no overarching framework. Although there are principled ways of learning such finite approximations, they are in many instances overlooked in favor of, often ill-posed and unstructured methods. Also, Koopman operator theory has long-standing connections to known system-theoretic and dynamical system notions that are not universally recognized. Given the former and latter realities, this work aims to bridge the gap between various concepts regarding both theory and tractable realizations. Firstly, we review data-driven representations (both unstructured and structured) for Koopman operator dynamical models, categorizing various existing methodologies and highlighting their differences. Furthermore, we provide concise insight into the paradigm's relation to system-theoretic notions and analyze the prospect of using the paradigm for modeling control systems. Additionally, we outline the current challenges and comment on future perspectives.},

   abstract = {The reduced basis method was introduced for the accurate online evaluation of solutions to a parameter dependent family of elliptic PDEs. Abstractly, it can be viewed as determining a "good" n-dimensional space H n to be used in approximating the elements of a compact set F in a Hilbert space H. One by now popular computational approach is to find H n through a greedy strategy. It is natural to compare the approximation performance of the Hn generated by this strategy with that of the Kolmogorov widths dn(F) since the latter gives the smallest error that can be achieved by subspaces of fixed dimension n. The first such comparisons, given in [A. Buffa et al., ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 2011, to appear], show that the approximation error, ηn(F) := dist(F,Hn), obtained by the greedy strategy satisfies sn(F) ≤ Cn2ndn(F). In this paper, various improvements of this result will be given. Among these, it is shown that whenever dn(F) ≤ Mn -α for all n > 0 and some M,α > 0, we also have ηn(F) ≤ CαMn-α for all n > 0, where Ca depends only on α. Similar results are derived for generalized exponential rates of the form Me-anα . The exact greedy algorithm is not always computationally feasible, and a commonly used computationally friendly variant can be formulated as a "weak greedy algorithm." The results of this paper are established for this version as well. © 2011 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

It performs MOR directly on the spectral factor inheriting the original system's sparsity enabling MOR in a large-scale context. Our analysis reveals that the spectral factorization corresponding to the minimal solution of an associated algebraic Riccati equation is preferable from a model reduction perspective and benefits pH-preserving MOR methods such as a modified version of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA).

   abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

   abstract = {<p>Parametric high-fidelity simulations are of interest for a wide range of applications. However, the restriction of computational resources renders such models to be inapplicable in a real-time context or in multi-query scenarios. Model order reduction (MOR) is used to tackle this issue. Recently, MOR is extended to preserve specific structures of the model throughout the reduction, e.g., structure-preserving MOR for Hamiltonian systems. This is referred to as symplectic MOR. It is based on the classical projection-based MOR and uses a symplectic reduced order basis (ROB). Such an ROB can be derived in a data-driven manner with the Proper Symplectic Decomposition (PSD) in the form of a minimization problem. Due to the strong nonlinearity of the minimization problem, it is unclear how to efficiently find a global optimum. In our paper, we show that current solution procedures almost exclusively yield suboptimal solutions by restricting to orthonormal ROBs. As a new methodological contribution, we propose a new method which eliminates this restriction by generating non-orthonormal ROBs. In the numerical experiments, we examine the different techniques for a classical linear elasticity problem and observe that the non-orthonormal technique proposed in this paper shows superior results with respect to the error introduced by the reduction.</p>},

@article{Buchfink2023,
   abstract = {methods are, e.g., the reduced basis method, the proper orthogonal decomposition, and balanced truncation; see [3] for an introduction to different MOR methods. In this paper, our focus is on reducing dynamical systems of ordinary differential equations, which often arise from spatial discretization of partial differential equations. These dynamical systems frequently possess physical characteristics of the modeled phenomena such as an underlying structure or conservation properties. Possible structures that have been addressed in the context of MOR comprise, e.g., Lagrangian [13, 36], Hamiltonian, or port-Hamiltonian [2, 14, 54] structures. We are in particular interested in preserving Hamiltonian systems arising in, e.g., plasma physics [45] or gyroscopic systems [64]. To this end we derive a reduced Hamiltonian system which preserves symplecticity, as otherwise the reduced system could become unphysical in the sense that the energy is not conserved or stability properties are lost. Structure-preserving model reduction for Hamiltonian systems has already been presented for linear-subspace methods in [6, 7, 42, 53, 58, 60], for nonlinear Poisson systems in [26], and in [27, 49] utilizing a dynamical-in-time approach motivated by low-rank approximations. We extend this literature by developing reduced models for Hamiltonian systems on nonlinear symplectic trial manifolds, which can drastically lower the dimension of the reduced model needed to build an accurate reduced model. One motivation for using nonlinear manifolds as low-dimensional approximations instead of linear subspaces arises from model reduction of transport-dominated problems. It is known that such problems can exhibit a slow decay of the Kolmogorov-n-widths of, e.g., n-1/2 [22, 47], which describes the best-possible error for a linear-subspace reduced-order model (ROM) of size n. Recent efforts to break the Kolmogorov-n-widths for transport problems include transforming and shifting the basis functions as well as the physical domain of the individual snapshots [5, 8, 30, 55, 62], online adaptive model reduction approaches [10, 51, 52], registration-based model reduction [59], model reduction on metric spaces [17], the method of freezing [46], and splitting of one global domain into multiple local linear subspaces [48]. Model reduction for general nonlinear manifolds has already been performed in [23], which is limited to piecewise-linear manifolds, and in [15], where the manifolds are constructed via moment matching and the equations of the nonlinear dynamical systems have to be known. In [56], the authors introduced manifold approximations via transported subspaces, which restricts our attention to 1D problems for now. Recent approaches using autoencoders have been introduced in [40] as MOR on manifolds and extended in [41] to satisfy physical conservation laws. In [32], a shallow masked autoencoder combined with a hyper-reduction approach has been employed to construct a reduced manifold. In [18], the authors not only learn a reduced manifold via an autoencoder, but also utilize a feed-forward network to approximate the reduced model. To the best of our knowledge the aforementioned approaches consider either sym-plectic model reduction or MOR on manifolds but not their combination. Our goal is to bridge the two approaches by providing a method for symplectic model reduction on manifolds. In particular, this article provides the following new contributions: 1. Symplectic manifold Galerkin (SMG) projection techniques, which project Hamiltonian systems on nonlinear symplectic trial manifolds (section 2.3). Using this technique, the resulting SMG-ROM is again a Hamiltonian system. 2. Analysis, which includes: \bullet Preservation of energy and stability: We detail sufficient conditions for the reduced model to be energy-preserving and/or stability-preserving in the sense of Lyapunov (sections 2.4 and 2.5).},

   abstract = {This article describes the extension of the conformal symplectic method to solve the damped acoustic wave equation and the elastic wave equations in the framework of the spectral element method. The conformal symplectic method is a variation of conventional symplectic methods to treat non-conservative time evolution problems, which has superior behaviors in long-time stability and dissipation preservation. To reveal the intrinsic dissipative properties of the model equations, we first reformulate the original systems in their equivalent conformal multi-symplectic structures and derive the corresponding conformal symplectic conservation laws. We thereafter separate each system into a conservative Hamiltonian system and a purely dissipative ordinary differential equation system. Based on the splitting methodology, we solve the two subsystems respectively. The dissipative one is cheaply solved by its analytic solution. While for the conservative system, we combine a fourth-order symplectic Nyström method in time and the spectral element method in space to cover the circumstances in realistic geological structures involving complex free-surface topography. The Strang composition method is adopted thereby to concatenate the corresponding two parts of solutions and generate the completed conformal symplectic method. A relative larger Courant number than that of the traditional Newmark scheme is found in the numerical experiments in conjunction with a spatial sampling of approximately 5 points per wavelength. A benchmark test for the damped acoustic wave equation validates the effectiveness of our proposed method in precisely capturing dissipation rate. The classical Lamb problem is used to demonstrate the ability of modeling Rayleigh wave in elastic wave propagation. More comprehensive numerical experiments are presented to investigate the long-time simulation, low dispersion and energy conservation properties of the conformal symplectic methods in both the attenuating homogeneous and heterogeneous media.},

   abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results. © 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

   abstract = {Given a Banach space X and one of its compact sets F, we consider the problem of finding a good n-dimensional space X n⊂X which can be used to approximate the elements of F. The best possible error we can achieve for such an approximation is given by the Kolmogorov width dn(F)X. However, finding the space which gives this performance is typically numerically intractable. Recently, a new greedy strategy for obtaining good spaces was given in the context of the reduced basis method for solving a parametric family of PDEs. The performance of this greedy algorithm was initially analyzed in Buffa et al. (Modél. Math. Anal. Numér. 46:595-603, 2012) in the case X=H is a Hilbert space. The results of Buffa et al. (Modél.

The purpose of the present paper is to give a new analysis of the performance of such greedy algorithms. Our analysis not only gives improved results for the Hilbert space case but can also be applied to the same greedy procedure in general Banach spaces. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {The subject of partial differential equations holds an exciting and special position in mathematics. Partial differential equations were not consciously created as a subject but emerged in the 18th century as ordinary differential equations failed to describe the physical principles being studied. The subject was originally developed by the major names of mathematics, in particular, Leonard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange who studied waves on strings; Daniel Bernoulli and Euler who considered potential theory, with later developments by Adrien-Marie Legendre and Pierre-Simon Laplace; and Joseph Fourier's famous work on series expansions for the heat equation. Many of the greatest advances in modern science have been based on discovering the underlying partial differential equation for the process in question. J ames Clerk Maxwell, for example, put electricity and magnetism into a unified theory by estab­ lishing Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic theory, which gave solutions for problems in radio wave propagation, the diffraction of light and X-ray developments. Schrodinger's equation for quantum mechankal processes at the atomic level leads to experimentally verifiable results which have changed the face of atomic physics and chemistry in the 20th century. In fluid mechanics, the Navier-Stokes' equations form a basis for huge number-crunching activities associated with such widely disparate topics as weather forcasting and the design of supersonic aircraft. Inevitably the study of partial differential equations is a large undertaking, and falls into several areas of mathematics.},

The key ingredient of the approach is a polynomial mapping between high-dimensional states and a low-dimensional embedding. This mapping consists of two parts: a representation in a linear subspace (computed in this work using the proper orthogonal decomposition) and a quadratic component. The approach can be viewed as a form of data-driven closure modeling, since the quadratic component introduces directions into the approximation that lie in the orthogonal complement of the linear subspace, but without introducing any additional degrees of freedom to the low-dimensional representation. Combining the quadratic manifold approximation with the operator inference method for projection-based model reduction leads to a scalable non-intrusive approach for learning reduced-order models of dynamical systems. Applying the new approach to transport-dominated systems of partial differential equations illustrates the gains in efficiency that can be achieved over approximation in a linear subspace.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the nearest positive real (PR) system to a non-PR system: given an LTI control system defined by Ex = Ax + Bu and y = Cx + Du, minimize the Frobenius norm of (∆E, ∆A, ∆B, ∆C, ∆D) such that (E + ∆E, A + ∆A, B + ∆B, C + ∆C, D + ∆D) is a PR system. We first show that a system is extended strictly PR if and only if it can be written as a strict port-Hamiltonian system. This allows us to reformulate the nearest PR system problem into an optimization problem with a simple convex feasible set. We then use a fast gradient method to obtain a nearby PR system to a given non-PR system and illustrate the behavior of our algorithm with several examples. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithm that computes a nearby PR system to a given non-PR system that (i) is not based on the spectral properties of related Hamiltonian matrices or pencils, (ii) allows one to perturb all matrices (E, A, B, C, D) describing the system, and (iii) does not make any assumption on the original given system.},

   abstract = {The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method used for identifying the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems. It extracts important characteristics of the underlying dynamics using measured time-domain data produced either by means of experiments or by numerical simulations. In the original methodology, the measurements are assumed to be approximately related by a linear operator. Hence, a linear discrete-time system is fitted to the given data. However, often, nonlinear systems modeling physical phenomena have a particular known structure. In this contribution, we propose an identification and reduction method based on the classical DMD approach allowing to fit a structured nonlinear system to the measured data. We mainly focus on two types of nonlinearities: bilinear and quadratic bilinear. By enforcing this additional structure, more insight into extracting the nonlinear behavior of the original process is gained. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed methodology for different examples, such as Burgers’ equation and the coupled van der Pol oscillators.},

The essential new ingredient is the presence of time in the formulation and solution of the problem – we shall “simply” treat time as an additional, albeit special, parameter. First, we introduce the reduced-basis recipe – Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter-time space – and develop a new greedy adaptive procedure to “optimally” construct the parameter-time sample set. Second, we propose error estimation and adjoint procedures that provide rigorous and sharp bounds for the error in specific outputs of interest: the estimates serve a priori to construct our samples, and a posteriori to confirm fidelity. Third, based on the assumption of affine parameter dependence, we develop offline-online computational procedures: in the offline stage, we generate the reduced-basis space; in the online stage, given a new parameter value, we calculate the reduced-basis output and associated error bound. The operation count for the online stage depends only on N (typically small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for repeated, rapid, reliable evaluation of input-output relationships in the many-query or real-time contexts.},

   abstract = {We present a projection-based nonlinear model order reduction method, named model order reduction via quadratic-linear systems (QLMOR). QLMOR employs two novel ideas: 1) we show that nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and more generally differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) with many commonly encountered nonlinear kernels can be re-written equivalently in a special representation, quadratic-linear differential algebraic equations (QLDAEs), and 2) we perform a Volterra analysis to derive the Volterra kernels, and we adapt the moment-matching reduction technique of nonlinear model order reduction method (NORM) to reduce these QLDAEs into QLDAEs of much smaller size. Because of the generality of the QLDAE representation, QLMOR has significantly broader applicability than Taylor-expansion-based methods [1]-[3] since there is no approximation involved in the transformation from original DAEs to QLDAEs. Because the reduced model has only quadratic nonlinearities, its computational complexity is less than that of similar prior methods. In addition, QLMOR, unlike NORM, totally avoids explicit moment calculations, hence it has improved numerical stability properties as well. We compare QLMOR against prior methods [1]-[3] on a circuit and a biochemical reaction-like system, and demonstrate that QLMOR-reduced models retain accuracy over a significantly wider range of excitation than Taylor-expansion-based methods [1]-[3]. QLMOR, therefore, demonstrates that Volterra-kernel-based nonlinear MOR techniques can in fact have far broader applicability than previously suspected, possibly being competitive with trajectory-based methods (e.g., trajectory piece-wise linear reduced order modeling [4]) and nonlinear-projection-based methods (e.g., maniMOR [5]). © 2011 IEEE.},

In the literature, two independent frameworks have evolved focusing either on solution of Lyapunov equations on the one hand or interpolation of transfer functions on the other, without any apparent connection between the two approaches. In this paper, we develop a new unifying framework for the optimal H 2 approximation problem using best approximation properties in the underlying Hilbert space. This new framework leads to a new set of local optimality conditions taking the form of a structured orthogonality condition. We show that the existing Lyapunovand interpolation-based conditions are each equivalent to our conditions and so are equivalent to each other. Also, we provide a new elementary proof of the interpolation-based condition that clarifies the importance of the mirror images of the reduced system poles. Based on the interpolation framework, we describe an iteratively corrected rational Krylov algorithm for H 2 model reduction. The formulation is based on finding a reduced order model that satisfies interpolation-based firstorder necessary conditions for H 2 optimality and results in a method that is numerically effective and suited for large-scale problems. We illustrate the performance of the method with a variety of numerical experiments and comparisons with existing methods. © 2008 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

   abstract = {High-resolution simulations of particle-based kinetic plasma models typically require a high number of particles and thus often become computationally intractable. This is exacerbated in multi-query simulations, where the problem depends on a set of parameters. In this work, we derive reduced order models for the semi-discrete Hamiltonian system resulting from a geometric particle-in-cell approximation of the parametric Vlasov-Poisson equations. Since the problem's non-dissipative and highly nonlinear nature makes it reducible only locally in time, we adopt a nonlinear reduced basis approach where the reduced phase space evolves in time. This strategy allows a significant reduction in the number of simulated particles, but the evaluation of the nonlinear operators associated with the Vlasov-Poisson coupling remains computationally expensive. We propose a novel reduction of the nonlinear terms that combines adaptive parameter sampling and hyper-reduction techniques to address this. The proposed approach allows decoupling the operations having a cost dependent on the number of particles from those that depend on the instances of the required parameters. In particular, in each time step, the electric potential is approximated via dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and the particle-to-grid map via a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). These approximations are constructed from data obtained from a past temporal window at a few selected values of the parameters to guarantee a computationally efficient adaptation. The resulting DMD-DEIM reduced dynamical system retains the Hamiltonian structure of the full model, provides good approximations of the solution, and can be solved at a reduced computational cost.},

Hamilton's principle completely characterizes many high-dimensional models in mathematical physics, resulting in rich geometric structures, with examples in fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, optical systems, and epidemiological models. MOR reduces the computational burden associated with the approximation of complex systems by introducing low-dimensional surrogate models, enabling efficient multi-query numerical simulations. However, standard reduction approaches do not guarantee the conservation of the delicate dynamics of Hamiltonian problems, resulting in reduced models plagued by instability or accuracy loss over time. By approaching the reduction process from the geometric perspective of symplectic manifolds, the resulting reduced models inherit stability and conservation properties of the high-dimensional formulations. We first introduce the general principles of symplectic geometry, including symplectic vector spaces, Darboux' theorem, and Hamiltonian vector fields. These notions are then used as a starting point to develop different structure-preserving reduced basis (RB) algorithms, including SVD-based approaches and greedy techniques. We conclude the review by addressing the reduction of problems that are not linearly reducible or in a non-canonical Hamiltonian form.},

   abstract = {Solar wind conditions are predominantly predicted via three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Despite their ability to produce highly accurate predictions, MHD models require computationally intensive high-dimensional simulations. This renders them inadequate for making time-sensitive predictions and for large-ensemble analysis required in uncertainty quantification. This paper presents a new data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) capability for forecasting heliospheric solar wind speeds. Traditional model reduction methods based on Galerkin projection have difficulties with advection-dominated systems—such as solar winds—since they require a large number of basis functions and can become unstable. A core contribution of this work addresses this challenge by extending the non-intrusive operator inference ROM framework to exploit the translational symmetries present in the solar wind caused by the Sun's rotation. The numerical results show that our method can adequately emulate the MHD simulations and is more accurate than a reduced-physics surrogate model, the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation model.},

The textbook starts with elementary known results, then progresses smoothly to advanced topics in current research. Many physical systems can be formulated using a Hamiltonian framework, leading to models described by ordinary or partial differential equations. For the purpose of control and for the interconnection of two or more Hamiltonian systems it is essential to take into account this interaction with the environment. This book is the first textbook on infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems. An abstract functional analytical approach is combined with the physical approach to Hamiltonian systems. This combined approach leads to easily verifiable conditions for well-posedness and stability. The book is accessible to graduate engineers and mathematicians with a minimal background in functional analysis. Moreover, the theory is illustrated by many worked-out examples.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

   abstract = {Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges.},

   abstract = {A limiter free high order spectral volume (SV) formulation is proposed in this paper to solve the Burgers' equation. This approach uses the Hopf-Cole transformation, which maps the Burgers' equation to a linear diffusion equation. This diffusion equation is solved in an SV setting. The local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) and the LDG2 viscous flux discretization methods were employed. An inverse transformation was used to obtain the numerical solution to the Burgers' equation. This procedure has two advantages: (i) the shock can be captured, without the use of a limiter; and (ii) the effects of SV partitioning becomes almost redundant as the transformed equation is not hyperbolic. Numerical studies were performed to verify. These studies also demonstrated (i) high order accuracy of the scheme even for very low viscosity; (ii) superiority of the LDG2 scheme, when compared with the LDG scheme. In general, the numerical results are very promising and indicate that this procedure can be applied for obtaining high order numerical solutions to other nonlinear partial differential equations (for instance, the Korteweg-de Vries equations) which generate discontinuous solutions. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The approach considers the particular case of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that form systems of partial differential–algebraic equations (PDAEs) when lifted to polynomial form. Such systems arise, for example, when the governing equations include Arrhenius reaction terms (e.g., in reacting flow models) and thermodynamic terms (e.g., the Helmholtz free energy terms in a phase-field solidification model). Using the known structured form of the lifted algebraic equations, the approach computes the reduced operators for the algebraic equations explicitly, using straightforward linear algebra operations on the basis matrices. The reduced operators for the differential equations are inferred from lifted snapshot data using operator inference, which solves a linear least squares regression problem. The approach is illustrated for the nonlinear model of solidification of a pure material. The lifting transformations reformulate the solidification PDEs as a system of PDAEs that have cubic structure. The operators of the lifted system for this solidification example have affine dependence on key process parameters, permitting us to learn a parametric reduced model with operator inference. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the resulting reduced models in capturing key aspects of the solidification dynamics.},

   abstract = {Traditional linear subspace reduced order models (LS-ROMs) are able to accelerate physical simulations in which the intrinsic solution space falls into a subspace with a small dimension, i.e., the solution space has a small Kolmogorov n-width. However, for physical phenomena not of this type, e.g., any advection-dominated flow phenomena such as in traffic flow, atmospheric flows, and air flow over vehicles, a low-dimensional linear subspace poorly approximates the solution. To address cases such as these, we have developed a fast and accurate physics-informed neural network ROM, namely nonlinear manifold ROM (NM-ROM), which can better approximate high-fidelity model solutions with a smaller latent space dimension than the LS-ROMs. Our method takes advantage of the existing numerical methods that are used to solve the corresponding full order models. The efficiency is achieved by developing a hyper-reduction technique in the context of the NM-ROM. Numerical results show that neural networks can learn a more efficient latent space representation on advection-dominated data from 1D and 2D Burgers' equations. A speedup of up to 2.6 for 1D Burgers' and a speedup of 11.7 for 2D Burgers' equations are achieved with an appropriate treatment of the nonlinear terms through a hyper-reduction technique. Finally, a posteriori error bounds for the NM-ROMs are derived that take account of the hyper-reduced operators.},

   abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium that causes serious infections in immunocompromised individuals and cystic fibrosis patients. This opportunistic pathogen controls many of its virulence factors and cellular functions through the activity of three cell-to-cell signals, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone, and the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). The activity of these signals is dependent upon their ability to dissolve in and freely diffuse through the aqueous solution in which P. aeruginosa happens to reside. Despite this, our data indicated that PQS was relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions, which led us to postulate that P. aeruginosa could be producing a PQS-solubilizing factor. In this report, we show that the P. aeruginosa-produced biosurfactant rhamnolipid greatly enhances the solubility of PQS in aqueous solutions. The enhanced solubility of PQS led to an increase in PQS bioactivity, as measured by both a gene induction assay and an apoptosis assay. This is the first demonstration of the importance of a bacterial surfactant in the solubilization and bioactivity of a cell-to-cell signal.},

A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Ni\~no mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

   abstract = {Nearly all model-reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. Such subspaces are typically computed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the reduced-basis method, and (balanced) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Unfortunately, restricting the state to evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs can be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if the problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., diffusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit a slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To address this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems onto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the time-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin projection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) projection. We perform analyses that provide insight into the relationship between these proposed approaches and classical linear-subspace reduced-order models; we also derive a posteriori discrete-time error bounds for the proposed approaches. In addition, we propose a computationally practical approach for computing the nonlinear manifold, which is based on convolutional autoencoders from deep learning. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the method to significantly outperform even the optimal linear-subspace ROM on benchmark advection-dominated problems, thereby demonstrating the method's ability to overcome the intrinsic n-width limitations of linear subspaces.},

   abstract = {In this thesis we study structure-preserving model reduction methods for the efficient and reliable approximation of dynamical systems. A major focus is the approximation of a nonlinear flow problem on networks, which can, e.g., be used to describe gas network systems. Our proposed approximation framework guarantees so-called port-Hamiltonian structure and is general enough to be realizable by projection-based model order reduction combined with complexity reduction. We divide the discussion of the flow problem into two parts, one concerned with the linear damped wave equation and the other one with the general nonlinear flow problem on networks.

The study around the linear damped wave equation relies on a Galerkin framework, which allows for convenient network generalizations. Notable contributions of this part are the profound analysis of the algebraic setting after space-discretization in relation to the infinite dimensional setting and its implications for model reduction. In particular, this includes the discussion of differential-algebraic structures associated to the network-character of our problem and the derivation of compatibility conditions related to fundamental physical properties. Amongst the different model reduction techniques, we consider the moment matching method to be a particularly well-suited choice in our framework.

The Galerkin framework is then appropriately extended to our general nonlinear flow problem. Crucial supplementary concepts are required for the analysis, such as the partial Legendre transform and a more careful discussion of the underlying energy-based modeling. The preservation of the port-Hamiltonian structure after the model-order- and complexity-reduction-step represents a major focus of this work. Similar as in the analysis of the model order reduction, compatibility conditions play a crucial role in the analysis of our complexity reduction, which relies on a quadrature-type ansatz. Furthermore, energy-stable time-discretization schemes are derived for our port-Hamiltonian approximations, as structure-preserving methods from literature are not applicable due to our rather unconventional parametrization of the solution.

Apart from the port-Hamiltonian approximation of the flow problem, another topic of this thesis is the derivation of a new extension of moment matching methods from linear systems to quadratic-bilinear systems. Most system-theoretic reduction methods for nonlinear systems rely on multivariate frequency representations. Our approach instead uses univariate frequency representations tailored towards user-defined families of inputs. Then moment matching corresponds to a one-dimensional interpolation problem rather than to a multi-dimensional interpolation as for the multivariate approaches, i.e., it involves fewer interpolation frequencies to be chosen. The notion of signal-generator-driven systems, variational expansions of the resulting autonomous systems as well as the derivation of convenient tensor-structured approximation conditions are the main ingredients of this part. Notably, our approach allows for the incorporation of general input relations in the state equations, not only affine-linear ones as in existing system-theoretic methods.},

   abstract = {The development of structure-preserving approximation methods, which regard fundamental underlying physical principles, is an active field of research. Especially when the application of model reduction is desirable, systematic and rather generic approaches are of great interest. In this contribution we discuss a structure-preserving Galerkin approach for a prototypical class of nonlinear partial differential equations on networks. Its derivation is guided by port-Hamiltonian-type modeling and appropriate variational principles. Also complexity-reduction schemes can be integrated in a structure-preserving way, which becomes crucial in the context of model reduction for nonlinear systems. 1 Model equations Let p = (w, ˜ w) ⊂ R be an interval and T > 0. We consider a class of prototypical hyperbolic partial differential equations with port-Hamiltonian structure: The state z : [0, T ] × p → R 2 is governed by ∂ t z(t, x) = −∂ x −∂ x −r(z(t, x)) z h(z(t, x)), x ∈ p, t ∈ [0, T ]. (1a) To close the system, data z 0 : p → R 2 and u ˆ w : [0, T ] → R forˆwforˆ forˆw ∈ \{w, ˜ w\} is assumed to be given to prescribe initial conditions z(0, x) = z 0 (x) for x ∈ p, and one boundary condition per boundary, each of one of the following types, Type 1: z1 h(z(t, ˆ w)) = u ˆ w , Type 2: z2 h(z(t, ˆ w)) = u ˆ w t ∈ [0, T ], (1b) using the notation z = [z 1 ; z 2 ] and z h(z) = [ z1 h(z); z2 h(z)] for the respective column vectors. Throughout the paper we assume h to be continuously differentiable, convex, h(z) > 0, and r(z) ≥ 0 for all considered z. In the port-Hamiltonian context, cf. [7, 8] and references therein, the state z is referred to as energy variables and h as Hamiltonian density. The latter induces the Hamiltonian H(z) = p h(z)dx, which can be interpreted as energy functional. The term r models energy dissipation. We furthermore require the initial-and boundary-data to be such that (1) is well-posed and omits a smooth solution. Example 1.1 All these assumptions posed on (1) are, for example, fulfilled in the modeling of gas network systems with one of the following set of equations [1, 2, 4-6]. • Isentropic Euler equations: The equations for density ρ and velocity v for x ∈ p, t ≥ 0 read ∂ t ρ + ∂ x (ρv) = 0, ∂ t (ρv) + ∂ x (ρv 2 + ˆ p(ρ)) = −c f |ρv| ρ ρv with pressurê p(ρ) = c p ρ γ for constants γ > 1, c f , c p > 0. To rewrite the system as in (1a), we introduce z = [ρ; v], h(z) = ρ v 2 2 + 1 γ−1 ˆ p(ρ), r(z) = c f |v| ρ. • Simplified isentropic Euler equations: These equations result from the isentropic Euler equations by neglecting the term ∂ x (ρv 2). Reformulation (1a) is obtained for m = ρv and z = [ρ; m], h(z) = 1 2 m 2 + ρ γ+1ˆpγ+1ˆ γ+1ˆp(ρ), r(z) = c f |m| ρ. • Damped wave equation: A damped wave equation is obtained for h(z) = 1/2(z 2 1 + z 2 2), r(z) > 0 for all z. The system is linear, when r is chosen to be constant. Note that in contrast to the isentropic Euler equations, the simplified version inherits a Hamiltonian density, which is separable into h(z) = h 1 (z 1) + h 2 (z 2) with quadratic h 2. For the damped wave equation, the Hamiltonian density is a fully quadratic function and z = z h(z).},

The motivation comes from an elementary model of shock waves in brass wind instruments, that proves useful in musical acoustics. Such a model results from the coupling of a conservative nonlinear system with a dissipative term; here the dissipation is represented by a fractional derivative in time, for which equivalent diffusive representations can be effciently used: in a first part, strong solutions, weak solutions and energy balances are examined. In a second part, ad hoc numerical schemes are derived, in order to capture all the physical phenomena at stake in the original model, and to get rid, as far as possible, of the spurious numerical effects which are highly undesirable: to this end, conservative schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, diffusive realizations for the fractional derivatives and integrals, and splitting of the two are being used. © IFAC.},

The non-intrusive nature of the approach enables variable transformations that expose system structure. The specific contribution of this paper is to advance the formulation robustness and algorithmic scalability of the Operator Inference approach. Regularisation is introduced to the formulation to avoid over-fitting. The task of determining an optimal regularisation is posed as an optimisation problem that balances training error and stability of long-time integration dynamics. A scalable algorithm and open-source implementation are presented, then demonstrated for a single-injector rocket combustion example. This example exhibits rich dynamics that are difficult to capture with state-of-the-art reduced models. With appropriate regularisation and an informed selection of learning variables, the reduced-order models exhibit high accuracy in re-predicting the training regime and acceptable accuracy in predicting future dynamics, while achieving close to a million times speedup in computational cost. When compared to a state-of-the-art model reduction method, the Operator Inference models provide the same or better accuracy at approximately one thousandth of the computational cost.},

Simulation results motivate the need for such constraints and are used for comparison with familiar alternative methods.

   abstract = {Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decomposition of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the “internally balanced” model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations of Xc, Xo, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.

This provides information about the energy of the system that can be a guideline in establishing well-posedness on an appropriate state space. Recent work on a port-Hamiltonian approach to approximation shows promise in obtaining finite-dimensional approximations that are useful for control and estimation. A key feature of the port-Hamiltonian approach is careful attention to how the energy in the system is modelled and approximated. How does this approach compare to more traditional approaches to scientific computation? In particular, what are the similarities and what are the differences?

The development of reduced basis methods for such models is challenged by two main factors: the rich geometric structure encoding the physical and stability properties of the dynamics and its local low-rank nature. To address these aspects, we propose a nonlinear structure-preserving model reduction where the reduced phase space evolves in time. In the spirit of dynamical low-rank approximation, the reduced dynamics is obtained by a symplectic projection of the Hamiltonian vector field onto the tangent space of the approximation manifold at each reduced state. A priori error estimates are established in terms of the projection error of the full model solution onto the reduced manifold. For the temporal discretization of the reduced dynamics we employ splitting techniques. The reduced basis satisfies an evolution equation on the manifold of symplectic and orthogonal rectangular matrices having one dimension equal to the size of the full model. We recast the problem on the tangent space of the matrix manifold and develop intrinsic temporal integrators based on Lie group techniques together with explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes. The resulting methods are shown to converge with the order of the RK integrator and their computational complexity depends only linearly on the dimension of the full model, provided the evaluation of the reduced flow velocity has a comparable cost.},

   abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive projection-based model reduction approach for full models based on time-dependent partial differential equations. Projection-based model reduction constructs the operators of a reduced model by projecting the equations of the full model onto a reduced space. Traditionally, this projection is intrusive, which means that the full-model operators are required either explicitly in an assembled form or implicitly through a routine that returns the action of the operators on a given vector; however, in many situations the full model is given as a black box that computes trajectories of the full-model states and outputs for given initial conditions and inputs, but does not provide the full-model operators. Our nonintrusive operator inference approach infers approximations of the reduced operators from the initial conditions, inputs, trajectories of the states, and outputs of the full model, without requiring the full-model operators. Our operator inference is applicable to full models that are linear in the state or have a low-order polynomial nonlinear term. The inferred operators are the solution of a least-squares problem and converge, with sufficient state trajectory data, in the Frobenius norm to the reduced operators that would be obtained via an intrusive projection of the full-model operators. Our numerical results demonstrate operator inference on a linear climate model and on a tubular reactor model with a polynomial nonlinear term of third order.},

   abstract = {This work introduces a method for learning low-dimensional models from data of high-dimensional black-box dynamical systems. The novelty is that the learned models are exactly the reduced models that are traditionally constructed with classical projection-based model reduction techniques. Thus, the proposed approach learns models that are guaranteed to have the well-studied properties of reduced models known from model reduction, without requiring full knowledge of the governing equations and without requiring the operators of the high-dimensional systems. The key ingredient is a new data sampling scheme to obtain re-projected trajectories of high-dimensional systems that correspond to Markovian dynamics in low-dimensional subspaces. The exact recovery of reduced models from these re-projected trajectories is guaranteed preasymptotically under certain conditions for finite amounts of data and for a large class of systems with polynomial nonlinear terms. Numerical results demonstrate that the low-dimensional models learned with the proposed approach match reduced models from traditional model reduction up to numerical errors in practice. The numerical results further indicate that low-dimensional models fitted to re-projected trajectories are predictive even in situations where models fitted to trajectories without re-projection are inaccurate and unstable.},

They are often given by discretizations of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations yielding high–dimensional discrete phase spaces. for this reason during the last decades research was mainly focused on the development of sophisticated analytical and numerical tools to understand the overall system behavior. Not surprisingly, the number of degrees of freedom for simulations keptpace with the increasing computing power. But when it comes to optimal design or control the problems are in general to large to be tackled with standard techniques. Hence, there is a strong need for model reduction techniques to reduce the computational costs and storage requirements. They should yield low–dimensional approximations for the full high–dimensional dynamical system, which reproduce the characteristic dynamics of the system.},

DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations-only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

   abstract = {We present a new scientific machine learning method that learns from data a computationally inexpensive surrogate model for predicting the evolution of a system governed by a time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), an enabling technology for many computational algorithms used in engineering settings. Our formulation generalizes to the function space PDE setting the Operator Inference method previously developed in [B. Peherstorfer and K. Willcox, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 306 (2016), pp. 196–215] for systems governed by ordinary differential equations. The method brings together two main elements. First, ideas from projection-based model reduction are used to explicitly parametrize the learned model by low-dimensional polynomial operators which reflect the known form of the governing PDE. Second, supervised machine learning tools are used to infer from data the reduced operators of this physics-informed parametrization. For systems whose governing PDEs contain more general (nonpolynomial) nonlinearities, the learned model performance can be improved through the use of lifting variable transformations, which expose polynomial structure in the PDE. The proposed method is demonstrated on two examples: a heat equation model problem that demonstrates the benefits of the function space formulation in terms of consistency with the underlying continuous truth, and a three-dimensional combustion simulation with over 18 million degrees of freedom, for which the learned reduced models achieve accurate predictions with a dimension reduction of five orders of magnitude and model runtime reduction of up to nine orders of magnitude.},

The method exploits knowledge of a system's governing equations to identify a coordinate transformation in which the system dynamics have quadratic structure. This transformation is called a lifting map because it often adds auxiliary variables to the system state. The lifting map is applied to data obtained by evaluating a model for the original nonlinear system. This lifted data is projected onto its leading principal components, and low-dimensional linear and quadratic matrix operators are fit to the lifted reduced data using a least-squares operator inference procedure. Analysis of our method shows that the Lift & Learn models are able to capture the system physics in the lifted coordinates at least as accurately as traditional intrusive model reduction approaches. This preservation of system physics makes the Lift & Learn models robust to changes in inputs. Numerical experiments on the FitzHugh–Nagumo neuron activation model and the compressible Euler equations demonstrate the generalizability of our model.},

   abstract = {Non-affine parametric dependencies, nonlinearities and advection-dominated regimes of the model of interest can result in a slow Kolmogorov n-width decay, which precludes the realization of efficient reduced-order models based on linear subspace approximations. Among the possible solutions, there are purely data-driven methods that leverage autoencoders and their variants to learn a latent representation of the dynamical system, and then evolve it in time with another architecture. Despite their success in many applications where standard linear techniques fail, more has to be done to increase the interpretability of the results, especially outside the training range and not in regimes characterized by an abundance of data. Not to mention that none of the knowledge on the physics of the model is exploited during the predictive phase. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we implement the non-linear manifold method introduced by Lee and Carlberg (J Comput Phys 404:108973, 2020) with hyper-reduction achieved through reduced over-collocation and teacher–student training of a reduced decoder. We test the methodology on a 2d non-linear conservation law and a 2d shallow water models, and compare the results obtained with a purely data-driven method for which the dynamics is evolved in time with a long-short term memory network.},

In this framework, static derivatives emerge as natural extensions to the modal derivatives for displacement fields other than the vibration modes, such as the Krylov subspace vectors. In the nonlinear projection framework employed here, the dynamic problem is projected onto the tangent space of the quadratic manifold, allowing for a much lower number of generalized coordinates compared to linear basis methods.

   abstract = {We propose a nonlinear reduced basis method for the efficient approximation of parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs), exploiting kernel proper orthogonal decomposition (KPOD) for the generation of a reduced order space and neural networks for the evaluation of the reduced order approximation. In particular, we use KPOD in place of the more classical POD, on a set of high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand to extract a reduced basis. This method provides a more accurate approximation of the snapshots' set featuring a lower dimension, while maintaining the same efficiency as POD. A neural network (NN) is then used to find the coefficients of the reduced basis by following a supervised learning paradigm and shown to be effective in learning the map between the time/parameter values and the projection of the high-fidelity snapshots onto the reduced space. In this NN, both the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons vary according to the intrinsic dimension of the differential problem at hand and the size of the reduced space. This adaptively built NN attains good performances in both the learning and the testing phases. Our approach is then tested on two benchmark problems, a one-dimensional wave equation and a two-dimensional nonlinear lid-driven cavity problem. We finally compare the proposed KPOD-NN technique with a POD-NN strategy, showing that KPOD allows a reduction of the number of modes that must be retained to reach a given accuracy in the reduced basis approximation. For this reason, the NN built to find the coefficients of the KPOD expansion is smaller, easier and less computationally demanding to train than the one used in the POD-NN strategy.},

   abstract = {We develop an optimization-based algorithm for parametric model order reduction (PMOR) of linear time-invariant dynamical systems. Our method aims at minimizing the $\mathcal\{H\}_\infty \otimes \mathcal\{L\}_\infty$ approximation error in the frequency and parameter domain by an optimization of the reduced order model (ROM) matrices. State-of-the-art PMOR methods often compute several nonparametric ROMs for different parameter samples, which are then combined to a single parametric ROM. However, these parametric ROMs can have a low accuracy between the utilized sample points. In contrast, our optimization-based PMOR method minimizes the approximation error across the entire parameter domain. Moreover, due to our flexible approach of optimizing the system matrices directly, we can enforce favorable features such as a port-Hamiltonian structure in our ROMs across the entire parameter domain. Our method is an extension of the recently developed SOBMOR-algorithm to parametric systems. We extend both the ROM parameterization and the adaptive sampling procedure to the parametric case. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our method in a comparison with other PMOR methods.},

   abstract = {A 2D wave equation with boundary damping of impedance type can be recast into an infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian system (pHs) with an appropriate feedback law, where the structure operator J is formally skew-symmetric. It is known that the underlying semigroup proves dissipative, even though no dissipation operator R is to be found in the pHs model. The Partitioned Finite Element Method (PFEM) introduced in Cardoso-Ribeiro et al. (2018), is structure-preserving and provides a natural way to discretize such systems. It gives rise to a non null symmetric matrix R. Moreover, since this matrix accounts for boundary damping, its rank is very low: only the basis functions at the boundary have an influence. Lastly, this matrix can be factorized out when considering the boundary condition as a feedback law for the pHs, involving the impedance parameter. Note that pHs - as open system - is used here as a tool to accurately discretize the wave equation with boundary damping as a closed system. In the worked-out numerical examples in 2D, the isotropic and homogeneous case is presented and the influence of the impedance is assessed; then, an anisotropic and heterogeneous wave equation with space-varying impedance at the boundary is investigated.},

   abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive physics-preserving method to learn reduced-order models (ROMs) of canonical Hamiltonian systems. Traditional intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic Galerkin projection to construct Hamiltonian ROMs by projecting Hamilton's equations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic projection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Hamiltonian operator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the underlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the Hamiltonian functional to define and parametrize a Hamiltonian ROM form which can then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed method is gray-box in that it utilizes knowledge of the Hamiltonian structure at the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially local components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer code, only data to learn the models. Our numerical results demonstrate Hamiltonian operator inference on a linear wave equation, the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and a nonpolynomial sine–Gordon equation. Accurate long-time predictions far outside the training time interval for nonlinear examples illustrate the generalizability of our learned models.},

Classical symplectic model reduction approaches employ linear symplectic
subspaces for representing the high-dimensional system states in a
reduced-dimensional coordinate system. While these approximations respect the
symplectic nature of Hamiltonian systems, the linearity of the approximation
imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy that can be achieved. We
propose two different model reduction methods based on recently developed
quadratic manifolds, each presenting its own advantages and limitations. The
addition of quadratic terms in the state approximation, which sits at the heart
of the proposed methodologies, enables us to better represent intrinsic
low-dimensionality in the problem at hand. Both approaches are effective for
issuing predictions in settings well outside the range of their training data
while providing more accurate solutions than the linear symplectic
reduced-order models.},

Allowable equivalence transformations of such singular systems are specified. The present framework is shown to overcome several difficulties inherent in other treatments of singular systems, and to extend, in a natural and satisfying way, many results previously known only for regular state-space systems.
