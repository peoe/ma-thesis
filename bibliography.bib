   abstract = {A quadratic approximation manifold is presented for performing nonlinear, projection-based, model order reduction (PMOR). It constitutes a departure from the traditional affine subspace approximation that is aimed at mitigating the Kolmogorov barrier for nonlinear PMOR, particularly for convection-dominated transport problems. It builds on the data-driven approach underlying the traditional construction of projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs); is application-independent; is linearization-free; and therefore is robust for highly nonlinear problems. Most importantly, this approximation leads to quadratic PROMs that deliver the same accuracy as their traditional counterparts using however a much smaller dimension – typically, n2∼n1, where n2 and n1 denote the dimensions of the quadratic and traditional PROMs, respectively. The computational advantages of the proposed high-order approach to nonlinear PMOR over the traditional approach are highlighted for the detached-eddy simulation-based prediction of the Ahmed body turbulent wake flow, which is a popular CFD benchmark problem in the automotive industry. For a fixed accuracy level, these advantages include: a reduction of the total offline computational cost by a factor greater than five; a reduction of its online wall clock time by a factor greater than 32; and a reduction of the wall clock time of the underlying high-dimensional model by a factor greater than two orders of magnitude.},

In contrast to state-of-the-art model reduction methods that are intrusive and thus require full knowledge of the governing equations and the operators of a full model of the discretized dynamical system, the proposed approach requires only the non-polynomial terms in analytic form and learns the rest of the dynamics from snapshots computed with a potentially black-box full-model solver. The proposed method learns operators for the linear and polynomially nonlinear dynamics via a least-squares problem, where the given non-polynomial terms are incorporated on the right-hand side. The least-squares problem is linear and thus can be solved efficiently in practice. The proposed method is demonstrated on three problems governed by partial differential equations, namely the diffusion–reaction Chafee–Infante model, a tubular reactor model for reactive flows, and a batch-chromatography model that describes a chemical separation process. The numerical results provide evidence that the proposed approach learns reduced models that achieve comparable accuracy as models constructed with state-of-the-art intrusive model reduction methods that require full knowledge of the governing equations.},

   abstract = {<p>Parametric high-fidelity simulations are of interest for a wide range of applications. However, the restriction of computational resources renders such models to be inapplicable in a real-time context or in multi-query scenarios. Model order reduction (MOR) is used to tackle this issue. Recently, MOR is extended to preserve specific structures of the model throughout the reduction, e.g., structure-preserving MOR for Hamiltonian systems. This is referred to as symplectic MOR. It is based on the classical projection-based MOR and uses a symplectic reduced order basis (ROB). Such an ROB can be derived in a data-driven manner with the Proper Symplectic Decomposition (PSD) in the form of a minimization problem. Due to the strong nonlinearity of the minimization problem, it is unclear how to efficiently find a global optimum. In our paper, we show that current solution procedures almost exclusively yield suboptimal solutions by restricting to orthonormal ROBs. As a new methodological contribution, we propose a new method which eliminates this restriction by generating non-orthonormal ROBs. In the numerical experiments, we examine the different techniques for a classical linear elasticity problem and observe that the non-orthonormal technique proposed in this paper shows superior results with respect to the error introduced by the reduction.</p>},

The key ingredient of the approach is a polynomial mapping between high-dimensional states and a low-dimensional embedding. This mapping consists of two parts: a representation in a linear subspace (computed in this work using the proper orthogonal decomposition) and a quadratic component. The approach can be viewed as a form of data-driven closure modeling, since the quadratic component introduces directions into the approximation that lie in the orthogonal complement of the linear subspace, but without introducing any additional degrees of freedom to the low-dimensional representation. Combining the quadratic manifold approximation with the operator inference method for projection-based model reduction leads to a scalable non-intrusive approach for learning reduced-order models of dynamical systems. Applying the new approach to transport-dominated systems of partial differential equations illustrates the gains in efficiency that can be achieved over approximation in a linear subspace.},

By enforcing this additional structure, more insight into extracting the nonlinear behavior of the original process is gained.

   abstract = {High-resolution simulations of particle-based kinetic plasma models typically require a high number of particles and thus often become computationally intractable. This is exacerbated in multi-query simulations, where the problem depends on a set of parameters. In this work, we derive reduced order models for the semi-discrete Hamiltonian system resulting from a geometric particle-in-cell approximation of the parametric Vlasov-Poisson equations. Since the problem's non-dissipative and highly nonlinear nature makes it reducible only locally in time, we adopt a nonlinear reduced basis approach where the reduced phase space evolves in time. This strategy allows a significant reduction in the number of simulated particles, but the evaluation of the nonlinear operators associated with the Vlasov-Poisson coupling remains computationally expensive. We propose a novel reduction of the nonlinear terms that combines adaptive parameter sampling and hyper-reduction techniques to address this. The proposed approach allows decoupling the operations having a cost dependent on the number of particles from those that depend on the instances of the required parameters. In particular, in each time step, the electric potential is approximated via dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and the particle-to-grid map via a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). These approximations are constructed from data obtained from a past temporal window at a few selected values of the parameters to guarantee a computationally efficient adaptation. The resulting DMD-DEIM reduced dynamical system retains the Hamiltonian structure of the full model, provides good approximations of the solution, and can be solved at a reduced computational cost.},

MOR reduces the computational burden associated with the approximation of complex systems by introducing low-dimensional surrogate models, enabling efficient multi-query numerical simulations. However, standard reduction approaches do not guarantee the conservation of the delicate dynamics of Hamiltonian problems, resulting in reduced models plagued by instability or accuracy loss over time. By approaching the reduction process from the geometric perspective of symplectic manifolds, the resulting reduced models inherit stability and conservation properties of the high-dimensional formulations. We first introduce the general principles of symplectic geometry, including symplectic vector spaces, Darboux' theorem, and Hamiltonian vector fields. These notions are then used as a starting point to develop different structure-preserving reduced basis (RB) algorithms, including SVD-based approaches and greedy techniques.

   abstract = {Traditional linear subspace reduced order models (LS-ROMs) are able to accelerate physical simulations in which the intrinsic solution space falls into a subspace with a small dimension, i.e., the solution space has a small Kolmogorov n-width. However, for physical phenomena not of this type, e.g., any advection-dominated flow phenomena such as in traffic flow, atmospheric flows, and air flow over vehicles, a low-dimensional linear subspace poorly approximates the solution. To address cases such as these, we have developed a fast and accurate physics-informed neural network ROM, namely nonlinear manifold ROM (NM-ROM), which can better approximate high-fidelity model solutions with a smaller latent space dimension than the LS-ROMs. Our method takes advantage of the existing numerical methods that are used to solve the corresponding full order models. The efficiency is achieved by developing a hyper-reduction technique in the context of the NM-ROM. Numerical results show that neural networks can learn a more efficient latent space representation on advection-dominated data from 1D and 2D Burgers' equations. A speedup of up to 2.6 for 1D Burgers' and a speedup of 11.7 for 2D Burgers' equations are achieved with an appropriate treatment of the nonlinear terms through a hyper-reduction technique. Finally, a posteriori error bounds for the NM-ROMs are derived that take account of the hyper-reduced operators.},

   abstract = {We demonstrate that the integration of the recently developed dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with a multi-resolution analysis allows for a decomposition method capable of robustly separating complex systems into a hierarchy of multi-resolution time-scale components. A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Ni\~no mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

   abstract = {Nearly all model-reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. Such subspaces are typically computed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the reduced-basis method, and (balanced) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Unfortunately, restricting the state to evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs can be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if the problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., diffusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit a slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To address this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems onto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the time-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin projection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) projection. We perform analyses that provide insight into the relationship between these proposed approaches and classical linear-subspace reduced-order models; we also derive a posteriori discrete-time error bounds for the proposed approaches. In addition, we propose a computationally practical approach for computing the nonlinear manifold, which is based on convolutional autoencoders from deep learning. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the method to significantly outperform even the optimal linear-subspace ROM on benchmark advection-dominated problems, thereby demonstrating the method's ability to overcome the intrinsic n-width limitations of linear subspaces.},

   abstract = {In this thesis we study structure-preserving model reduction methods for the efficient and reliable approximation of dynamical systems. A major focus is the approximation of a nonlinear flow problem on networks, which can, e.g., be used to describe gas network systems. Our proposed approximation framework guarantees so-called port-Hamiltonian structure and is general enough to be realizable by projection-based model order reduction combined with complexity reduction. We divide the discussion of the flow problem into two parts, one concerned with the linear damped wave equation and the other one with the general nonlinear flow problem on networks.

The study around the linear damped wave equation relies on a Galerkin framework, which allows for convenient network generalizations. Notable contributions of this part are the profound analysis of the algebraic setting after space-discretization in relation to the infinite dimensional setting and its implications for model reduction. In particular, this includes the discussion of differential-algebraic structures associated to the network-character of our problem and the derivation of compatibility conditions related to fundamental physical properties. Amongst the different model reduction techniques, we consider the moment matching method to be a particularly well-suited choice in our framework.

The Galerkin framework is then appropriately extended to our general nonlinear flow problem. Crucial supplementary concepts are required for the analysis, such as the partial Legendre transform and a more careful discussion of the underlying energy-based modeling. The preservation of the port-Hamiltonian structure after the model-order- and complexity-reduction-step represents a major focus of this work. Similar as in the analysis of the model order reduction, compatibility conditions play a crucial role in the analysis of our complexity reduction, which relies on a quadrature-type ansatz. Furthermore, energy-stable time-discretization schemes are derived for our port-Hamiltonian approximations, as structure-preserving methods from literature are not applicable due to our rather unconventional parametrization of the solution.

Apart from the port-Hamiltonian approximation of the flow problem, another topic of this thesis is the derivation of a new extension of moment matching methods from linear systems to quadratic-bilinear systems. Most system-theoretic reduction methods for nonlinear systems rely on multivariate frequency representations. Our approach instead uses univariate frequency representations tailored towards user-defined families of inputs. Then moment matching corresponds to a one-dimensional interpolation problem rather than to a multi-dimensional interpolation as for the multivariate approaches, i.e., it involves fewer interpolation frequencies to be chosen. The notion of signal-generator-driven systems, variational expansions of the resulting autonomous systems as well as the derivation of convenient tensor-structured approximation conditions are the main ingredients of this part. Notably, our approach allows for the incorporation of general input relations in the state equations, not only affine-linear ones as in existing system-theoretic methods.},

   abstract = {The development of structure-preserving approximation methods, which regard fundamental underlying physical principles, is an active field of research. Especially when the application of model reduction is desirable, systematic and rather generic approaches are of great interest. In this contribution we discuss a structure-preserving Galerkin approach for a prototypical class of nonlinear partial differential equations on networks. Its derivation is guided by port-Hamiltonian-type modeling and appropriate variational principles. Also complexity-reduction schemes can be integrated in a structure-preserving way, which becomes crucial in the context of model reduction for nonlinear systems. 1 Model equations Let p = (w, ˜ w) ⊂ R be an interval and T > 0. We consider a class of prototypical hyperbolic partial differential equations with port-Hamiltonian structure: The state z : [0, T ] × p → R 2 is governed by ∂ t z(t, x) = −∂ x −∂ x −r(z(t, x)) z h(z(t, x)), x ∈ p, t ∈ [0, T ]. (1a) To close the system, data z 0 : p → R 2 and u ˆ w : [0, T ] → R forˆwforˆ forˆw ∈ \{w, ˜ w\} is assumed to be given to prescribe initial conditions z(0, x) = z 0 (x) for x ∈ p, and one boundary condition per boundary, each of one of the following types, Type 1: z1 h(z(t, ˆ w)) = u ˆ w , Type 2: z2 h(z(t, ˆ w)) = u ˆ w t ∈ [0, T ], (1b) using the notation z = [z 1 ; z 2 ] and z h(z) = [ z1 h(z); z2 h(z)] for the respective column vectors. Throughout the paper we assume h to be continuously differentiable, convex, h(z) > 0, and r(z) ≥ 0 for all considered z. In the port-Hamiltonian context, cf. [7, 8] and references therein, the state z is referred to as energy variables and h as Hamiltonian density. The latter induces the Hamiltonian H(z) = p h(z)dx, which can be interpreted as energy functional. The term r models energy dissipation. We furthermore require the initial-and boundary-data to be such that (1) is well-posed and omits a smooth solution. Example 1.1 All these assumptions posed on (1) are, for example, fulfilled in the modeling of gas network systems with one of the following set of equations [1, 2, 4-6]. • Isentropic Euler equations: The equations for density ρ and velocity v for x ∈ p, t ≥ 0 read ∂ t ρ + ∂ x (ρv) = 0, ∂ t (ρv) + ∂ x (ρv 2 + ˆ p(ρ)) = −c f |ρv| ρ ρv with pressurê p(ρ) = c p ρ γ for constants γ > 1, c f , c p > 0. To rewrite the system as in (1a), we introduce z = [ρ; v], h(z) = ρ v 2 2 + 1 γ−1 ˆ p(ρ), r(z) = c f |v| ρ. • Simplified isentropic Euler equations: These equations result from the isentropic Euler equations by neglecting the term ∂ x (ρv 2). Reformulation (1a) is obtained for m = ρv and z = [ρ; m], h(z) = 1 2 m 2 + ρ γ+1ˆpγ+1ˆ γ+1ˆp(ρ), r(z) = c f |m| ρ. • Damped wave equation: A damped wave equation is obtained for h(z) = 1/2(z 2 1 + z 2 2), r(z) > 0 for all z. The system is linear, when r is chosen to be constant. Note that in contrast to the isentropic Euler equations, the simplified version inherits a Hamiltonian density, which is separable into h(z) = h 1 (z 1) + h 2 (z 2) with quadratic h 2. For the damped wave equation, the Hamiltonian density is a fully quadratic function and z = z h(z).},

   abstract = {We consider model order reduction of parameterized Hamiltonian systems describing nondissipative phenomena, like wave-type and transport dominated problems. The development of reduced basis methods for such models is challenged by two main factors: the rich geometric structure encoding the physical and stability properties of the dynamics and its local low-rank nature. To address these aspects, we propose a nonlinear structure-preserving model reduction where the reduced phase space evolves in time. In the spirit of dynamical low-rank approximation, the reduced dynamics is obtained by a symplectic projection of the Hamiltonian vector field onto the tangent space of the approximation manifold at each reduced state. A priori error estimates are established in terms of the projection error of the full model solution onto the reduced manifold. For the temporal discretization of the reduced dynamics we employ splitting techniques. The reduced basis satisfies an evolution equation on the manifold of symplectic and orthogonal rectangular matrices having one dimension equal to the size of the full model. We recast the problem on the tangent space of the matrix manifold and develop intrinsic temporal integrators based on Lie group techniques together with explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes. The resulting methods are shown to converge with the order of the RK integrator and their computational complexity depends only linearly on the dimension of the full model, provided the evaluation of the reduced flow velocity has a comparable cost.},

   abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive projection-based model reduction approach for full models based on time-dependent partial differential equations. Projection-based model reduction constructs the operators of a reduced model by projecting the equations of the full model onto a reduced space. Traditionally, this projection is intrusive, which means that the full-model operators are required either explicitly in an assembled form or implicitly through a routine that returns the action of the operators on a given vector; however, in many situations the full model is given as a black box that computes trajectories of the full-model states and outputs for given initial conditions and inputs, but does not provide the full-model operators. Our nonintrusive operator inference approach infers approximations of the reduced operators from the initial conditions, inputs, trajectories of the states, and outputs of the full model, without requiring the full-model operators. Our operator inference is applicable to full models that are linear in the state or have a low-order polynomial nonlinear term. The inferred operators are the solution of a least-squares problem and converge, with sufficient state trajectory data, in the Frobenius norm to the reduced operators that would be obtained via an intrusive projection of the full-model operators. Our numerical results demonstrate operator inference on a linear climate model and on a tubular reactor model with a polynomial nonlinear term of third order.},

reduced over-collocation and teacher-student training of a reduced decoder. We

This generalization is obtained by a linearization of the static force with respect to the generalized coordinates, resulting in a shift of the quadratic behavior from the force to the manifold. In this framework, static derivatives emerge as natural extensions to the modal derivatives for displacement fields other than the vibration modes, such as the Krylov subspace vectors. In the nonlinear projection framework employed here, the dynamic problem is projected onto the tangent space of the quadratic manifold, allowing for a much lower number of generalized coordinates compared to linear basis methods. The potential of the quadratic manifold approach is investigated in a numerical study, where several variations of the approach are compared on different examples, giving a clear indication of where the proposed approach is applicable.},

   abstract = {We propose a nonlinear reduced basis method for the efficient approximation of parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs), exploiting kernel proper orthogonal decomposition (KPOD) for the generation of a reduced order space and neural networks for the evaluation of the reduced order approximation. In particular, we use KPOD in place of the more classical POD, on a set of high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand to extract a reduced basis. This method provides a more accurate approximation of the snapshots' set featuring a lower dimension, while maintaining the same efficiency as POD. A neural network (NN) is then used to find the coefficients of the reduced basis by following a supervised learning paradigm and shown to be effective in learning the map between the time/parameter values and the projection of the high-fidelity snapshots onto the reduced space. In this NN, both the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons vary according to the intrinsic dimension of the differential problem at hand and the size of the reduced space. This adaptively built NN attains good performances in both the learning and the testing phases. Our approach is then tested on two benchmark problems, a one-dimensional wave equation and a two-dimensional nonlinear lid-driven cavity problem. We finally compare the proposed KPOD-NN technique with a POD-NN strategy, showing that KPOD allows a reduction of the number of modes that must be retained to reach a given accuracy in the reduced basis approximation. For this reason, the NN built to find the coefficients of the KPOD expansion is smaller, easier and less computationally demanding to train than the one used in the POD-NN strategy.},

   abstract = {A 2D wave equation with boundary damping of impedance type can be recast into an infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian system (pHs) with an appropriate feedback law, where the structure operator J is formally skew-symmetric. It is known that the underlying semigroup proves dissipative, even though no dissipation operator R is to be found in the pHs model. The Partitioned Finite Element Method (PFEM) introduced in Cardoso-Ribeiro et al. (2018), is structure-preserving and provides a natural way to discretize such systems. It gives rise to a non null symmetric matrix R. Moreover, since this matrix accounts for boundary damping, its rank is very low: only the basis functions at the boundary have an influence. Lastly, this matrix can be factorized out when considering the boundary condition as a feedback law for the pHs, involving the impedance parameter. Note that pHs - as open system - is used here as a tool to accurately discretize the wave equation with boundary damping as a closed system. In the worked-out numerical examples in 2D, the isotropic and homogeneous case is presented and the influence of the impedance is assessed; then, an anisotropic and heterogeneous wave equation with space-varying impedance at the boundary is investigated.},

   abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive physics-preserving method to learn reduced-order models (ROMs) of canonical Hamiltonian systems. Traditional intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic Galerkin projection to construct Hamiltonian ROMs by projecting Hamilton's equations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic projection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Hamiltonian operator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the underlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the Hamiltonian functional to define and parametrize a Hamiltonian ROM form which can then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed method is gray-box in that it utilizes knowledge of the Hamiltonian structure at the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially local components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer code, only data to learn the models. Our numerical results demonstrate Hamiltonian operator inference on a linear wave equation, the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and a nonpolynomial sine–Gordon equation. Accurate long-time predictions far outside the training time interval for nonlinear examples illustrate the generalizability of our learned models.},

   abstract = {Slender structures with high stiffness-to-weight ratio form the main bearing element of modern engineering. This renders geometrical non-linear effects a key feature to be considered throughout the whole life-time of diverse structural components, such as Wind Turbine (WT) blades. Although the Finite Element (FE) method constitutes a well-established tool for the analysis of such systems, the resulting models are often prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources and thus cannot be implemented in the design. The problem of state estimation for condition diagnostics and control applications is therefore rendered a challenging and intricate task when it comes to systems experiencing geometrical non-linearities. This is firstly due to the computationally demanding FE models associated with such systems and, secondly, to the requirement that estimation methods must consider non-linear phenomena. The problem is further pronounced in online applications, where real-time performance is required, as is commonly the case in structural health monitoring (SHM). Within this context, the focus is on computationally efficient models that operate on subspaces of significantly smaller size as compared to the full-order problem and which can be tailored to the framework of non-linear state estimation. This study proposes the implementation of physics-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for response prediction of systems featuring geometrically non-linear effects. In so doing, the concept of modal derivatives is adopted and combined with a flexible multibody approach in order to capture secondorder effects, e.g. twist-bend coupling, that arise as the system departs from the linear regime. In identifying the vibration response of such structures, the ROMs are compounded with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for the non-linear state estimation. The outlined approach is tested on the real-time response prediction of a WT blade, assuming that a limited number of artificial vibration measurements is available. The effectiveness of the scheme is assessed as a tool for online SHM and vibration control.},
