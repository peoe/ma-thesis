   abstract = {We present a novel physics-informed system identification method to construct
a passive linear time-invariant system. In more detail, for a given quadratic
energy functional, measurements of the input, state, and output of a system in
the time domain, we find a realization that approximates the data well while
guaranteeing that the energy functional satisfies a dissipation inequality. To
this end, we use the framework of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems and modify the
dynamic mode decomposition to be feasible for continuous-time pH systems. We
propose an iterative numerical method to solve the corresponding least-squares
minimization problem. We construct an effective initialization of the algorithm
by studying the least-squares problem in a weighted norm, for which we present
the analytical minimum-norm solution. The efficiency of the proposed method is
demonstrated with several numerical examples.},
