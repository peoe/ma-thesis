In this chapter, we discuss how we use \ac{OI} methods to infer \ac{PH} systems.
We commence by describing two paradigms of \ac{OI} techniques for \ac{PH} systems: realization-based methods such as \ac{DMD} in Section~\ref{sec:realization-based-inference} and optimization-based algorithms such as \ac{PHDMD} and \ac{SOBMOR} in Section~\ref{sec:optimization-based-inference}.
Both of these approaches use nonintrusive data-driven methods in which we do not have access to the underlying system's matrices but their individual procedures distinguishes them from each other.
Realization-based \ac{OI} constructs a surrogate \ac{LTI} system from data alone and then produces a \ac{PH} system based on the matrices obtained from this proxy.
In contrast, we can skip the intermediary \ac{LTI} system in optimization-based algorithms which directly optimize the individual realization matrix entries under appropriately chosen constraints such that the final system is \ac{PH}.
