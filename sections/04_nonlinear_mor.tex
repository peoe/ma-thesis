\chapter{Inferring Models}\label{chap:inferring-models}

In this chapter we highlight some approaches to nonlinear inferrential \ac{MOR}.
We begin by introducing non-structured inference frameworks.
Firstly, Section~\ref{sec:nn-mor} introduces the idea of fixing the problems of linear MOR as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:limitations-linear-mor} by using \acp{NN} for high dimensional approximation.
Afterwards, we contrast this high-handed idea with a much simpler \ac{LSQ}-based projection in Section~\ref{sec:mor-quadratically-embedded-manifolds}.
Following this conceptual anchor point we introduce several ways how may obtain quadratic \ac{PH} models by means of operator inference/operator interpolation in Section~\ref{sec:inferring-ph-systems}.
Lastly, we combine the idea of quadratic models and inference-based modelling in Section~\ref{sec:quadratically-embedded-manifolds-ph-systems}.
