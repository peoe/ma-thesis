In this chapter, we discuss how we use \ac{OI} methods to infer \ac{PH} systems and thereafter construct these in conjunction with quadratically embedded manifolds for nonlinear \ac{MOR}.
We commence by describing some \ac{OI} techniques for \ac{PH} systems in Section~\ref{sec:inferring-ph-systems}.
Among these are some methods that first construct a data-based \ac{LTI} realization and then project this onto the closest positive real and the \ac{PH} realization, respectively.
Finally, we discuss how we can construct the quadratically embedded manifolds with these inference methods in Section~\ref{sec:quadratically-embedded-manifolds-ph-systems}.
