\chapter{Systems Theory}\label{chap:systems-theory}

Throughout this chapter we discuss \acp{DAE}.
In Section~\ref{sec:ltis}, we consider \ac{LTI} systems that describe special cases of \acp{DAE} where the individual coefficients remain constant over time.
In particular, we introduce concepts which are used in Chapter~\ref{chap:linear-mor} to construct reduced models from these \ac{LTI} systems.
Continuing from this foundation, we define linear \ac{PH} systems which constitute a particular form of \ac{LTI} systems and are hence also \acp{DAE} in Section~\ref{sec:phltis}.
Secondly, we describe how the linear \ac{PH} formulation can be extended to cover nonlinear variants and for additional context illustrate how these can be connected to geometric structures on manifolds known as \emph{Dirac structures} to create infinite-dimensional \ac{PH} systems.
Finally, we highlight a few examples for both \ac{LTI} and \ac{PH} systems in Section~\ref{sec:examples} to demonstrate how the concepts of this chapter can be used to model complex physical dynamics.
