\chapter{Systems Theory}\label{chap:systems-theory}

Throughout this chapter we discuss \emph{differential-algebraic equations} (DAEs).
At first we consider \acs{LTI}, which describe special cases of DAEs.
In particular, we introduce concepts which are used in Chapter~\ref{chap:linear-mor} to construct reduced models from these \ac{LTI} systems.
Continuing from this foundation, we introduce linear \ac{PH} systems, that constitute a particular form of \ac{LTI} systems and are hence also DAEs.
Secondly, we describe how the linear \ac{PH} formulation can be extended to cover nonlinear variants, and for additional context quickly mention how these can be connected to geometric structures on manifolds known as \emph{Dirac structures} to create infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems.
Finally, we highlight a few examples for both \ac{LTI} and port-Hamiltonian systems to demonstrate the contents of this chapter.
