\chapter{Systems Theory}\label{chap:systems-theory}

Throughout this chapter we discuss \emph{differential-algebraic equations} (DAEs).
At first we consider \emph{linear time-invariant} (LTI) systems, which describe special cases of DAEs.
In particular, we introduce concepts which are used in Chapter~\ref{chap:linear-mor} to construct reduced models from these LTI systems.
Continuing from this foundation, we introduce linear port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems, these constitute a particular form of LTI systems and are hence also DAEs.
Secondly, we describe how the linear pH formulation can be extended to cover nonlinear variants, and for additional context quickly show how these can be connected to geometric structures on manifolds known as \emph{Dirac structures}.
Finally, we highlight a few examples for both LTI and port-Hamiltonian systems.
