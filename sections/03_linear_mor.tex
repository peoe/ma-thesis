\chapter{\acl{MOR}}\label{chap:linear-mor}

This chapter introduces the concept of \acf{MOR}.
The aim of MOR is to create models of smaller dimension from \acfp{FOM} such that these \acfp{ROM} provide the best approximation of the \acp{FOM} possible.
Ultimately, the motivation behind creating low-dimensional ROMs is to speed up repeated computations in multi-query situations such as parameter optimization, model validation, or time-sensistive on-the-fly (online) computations for use within real-world applications.
As the central perspective for this thesis, we introduce two of the most prominent linear reduction frameworks for \ac{LTI} systems in Section~\ref{sec:system-mor}.
In order to effectively reduce \ac{PH} systems, we also have to take a look at preserving matrix structures during the reduction process.
We discuss two such structure-preserving algorithms in Section~\ref{sec:structure-preserving-mor}.
Afterwards, we demonstrate the drawbacks of linear model reduction by considering an abstract benchmark for aspects of the approximation quality of linear reduced models in Section~\ref{sec:limitations-linear-mor}.
Finally, we discuss strategies to mitigate the downsides of linear \ac{MOR} through nonlinear procedures in Sections~\ref{sec:nn-mor} and~\ref{sec:mor-quadratically-embedded-manifolds}.
