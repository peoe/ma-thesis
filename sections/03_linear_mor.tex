\chapter{\acl{MOR}}\label{chap:linear-mor}

This chapter introduces the concept of \ac{MOR}.
The aim of MOR is to create models of smaller dimension from \acp{FOM} such that these \acp{ROM} provide the best approximation possible.
Ultimately, the motivation behind creating low-dimensional ROMs is to speed up repeated computations in multi-query situations such as parameter optimization, model validation, or on-the-fly (online) computations for adjustments within real-world applications.
As the central perspective for this thesis we introduce two of the most prominent system theoretic linear reduction frameworks in Section~\ref{sec:system-mor}.
Because we want to consider certain subsets of sytems we also have to take a look at preserving structural constraints during the reduction in Section~\ref{sec:structure-preserving-mor}.
Finally we demonstrate the drawbacks of linear model reduction by considering an essential benchmark for the approximation quality of linear reduced models in Section~\ref{sec:limitations-linear-mor}.
