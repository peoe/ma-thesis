\section{Linear MOR using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition}\label{sec:pod}

The first part of this section is heavily based upon~\cite{Pinnau2008}.
\emph{Proper Orthogonal Decomposition} (POD) is also known as Principal Component Analysis~\cite{Hotelling1936}, or Karhunen-LoÃ¨ve Decomposition~\cite{Karhunen1946}.
Its aim is the selection of a subspace through its basis such that the subspace optimally approximates the given data in the least-squares sense.
This basis is also commonly known as the \emph{POD modes}.
In Model Order Reduction this takes the concrete form of selecting a set of solutions $y_1, \dots, y_N$ of a PDE to use as basis functions for the reduced model.
To this end multiple strategies are available of which we present the method of snapshots in Subsection~\ref{subsec:pod-snapshots} and the singular value decomposition in Subsection~\ref{subsec:pod-svd}.

\subsection{Method of Snapshots}\label{subsec:pod-snapshots}

For a set of \emph{solution snapshots} $\iset{y_i \in \bb{R}^n}{i = 1, \dots, m, y_i = y(\mu_i)}$ of a parametrized PDE we construct the data matrix
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pod-data-matrix}
    Y = \left( y_1, \dots, y_N \right) \in \bb{R}^{n \times m}
\end{equation}
whose columns make up the individual snapshots $y_i$.
To compute the associated modes we have to solve the eigenvalue problems
\begin{equation*}
    \forall i = 1, \dots, n \colon\quad Y\herm Y v_i = \lambda_i v_i
\end{equation*}
for a set of orthonormal basis vectors $\iset{v_i \in \bb{R}^m}{i = 1, \dots, d}$.
The corresponding POD basis is then given as
\begin{equation*}
    u_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda_i}} Y v_i.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Singular Value Decomposition}\label{subsec:pod-svd}

Computing POD modes using the \emph{Singular Value Decomposition} (SVD) is closely linked to the method of snapshots in Subsection~\ref{subsec:pod-snapshots}.
We once more consider the data matrix $Y \in \bb{R}^{n \times m}$ from~\eqref{eq:pod-data-matrix}.
First, we compute the SVD of $Y$
\begin{equation*}
    Y = U \Sigma V\herm
\end{equation*}
for unitary matrices $U \in \bb{R}^{n \times n}, V \in \bb{R}^{m \times m}$ and the diagonal matrix $\Sigma = \diag{\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_d, 0, \dots, 0}$ consisting of $d$ positive numbers $\sigma_1 \geq \cdots \geq \sigma_d > 0$.
We call the columns $u_i$ of $U$ and $v_i$ of $V$ left and right singular vectris to the singular values $\sigma_i$ respectively because they satisfy
\begin{equation*}
    Y v_i = \sigma_i u_i,\quad Y\herm u_i = \sigma_i v_i.
\end{equation*}
The POD basis then consists of the left singular vectors $u_i$.
